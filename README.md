## Data Structures in Python
This repository contains detailed, well-commented, and documented Python code for several fundamental data structures. We cover the basics of linked lists, binary trees, hash tables, and various algorithms to manipulate and interact with these data structures.

The purpose of this repository is to provide a reference point for software developers and computer science students interested in understanding and applying these data structures in their programs.
